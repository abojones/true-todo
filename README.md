# Todo List App

This is a react web app that allows you to create, delete and update items in a todo list, following the criteria specified [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oTj1uX8dyxbrW4A4wnDOhTMWX9apcecQiudNxMzgmok/edit)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in the browser. The page reloads if you make edits.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the watch mode. The tools used for unit testing are Jest and enzyme.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, bundling the files making them deployment ready.

## Potential Improvements/ideas

- Use server side rendering to improve speed and performance
- Code splitting if the app grows
- More extensive unit and behavioural testing
